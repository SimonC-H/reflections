When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Having a remote repository means that others can collaborate working on the file and it can be accessed from other remote devices. Keeping all the work local means it can only be accessed by that device and only be the user of that device. Remote repository also serves as a back up should the local repository and/or device is compromised or fails.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    one may still be working on changes and/or they may not be complete. One would not want changes that had not been validated being updated to the live project.
    they may not compile or may even run.
